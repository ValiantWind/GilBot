# Gil Bot 

A Multipurpose Guilded Bot, made using Guilded's Bot API.

**This Bot is a WIP. It is definitely not finished.**

## Description

This is the first bot I made using Guilded's Early Access Bot API.    

I applied for early access to their API and managed to get in.

I hope you find use to this bot :D

## Contributing


Contributions are always welcome, but if you don't have early access to Guilded's Bot API its going to be very difficult.

If you want to apply for their early access to their API, you can always fill out an application to get in at:

or you can just wait until its released to the public.

They can be new commands, code improvements, code optimizations.
